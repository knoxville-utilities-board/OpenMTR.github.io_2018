<br>

A programming student at PSCC. Enjoys scripting computers to preform tasks that really donâ€™t need scripts, watching
way too many YouTube videos, cooking, and woodworking. He also aspires towards software development when he moves on
from university, and hopes to one day build his own 4 axis CNC.
