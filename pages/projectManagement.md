## Communication
- [Trello](https://trello.com/about) uses a card system that allows all team members to see what tasks need<br /> to be done and who is doing them.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) allowed our team to communicate in real time and also allowed for continuous <br /> integration with Trello which updated team members when cards were added, moved, <br />or removed from lists.
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) allowed our team to have meetings when we weren't all able to meet in one location.

## Version Control
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an open source version control system designed for software projects big and small.
- [Github](https://github.com/) is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of git as well as adding its own features.

## Continuous integration
- [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) is an automation service that provides support building, deploying and automating our projects. Also, it's free to open source projects!

## Static Code Analysis
- [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com/)  provides the capability to highlight issues newly introduced during pull requests. This tool helps us keep our code base more in line with industry standards and practices.
