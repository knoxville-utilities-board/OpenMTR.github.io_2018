This week we got the pleasure of meeting up with our clients at KUB to give them a brief presentation of OpenMTR.  
Our hard work this semester has really paid off because they were super impressed!  We received some great
suggestions for things they like to hear for our final presentation, and we discussed some of the features we have
planned for implementation that we were able to get some great feedback on and make appropriate changes before we
wrap up.  We are going to be pushing through the finishing touches over the next few weeks so check back in every
week to see what we have up and running!

Matt – This week Matt is going to be editing our final presentation as it will have to lose some serious weight.  Our
first run went for at least 40 minutes and we need to cut that in half!  He will also be working on our final
documentation this week, making sure no member of the team is drowning in the waters of knowledge.

Nick – Nick has been working on the Demo for weeks, and he has made some fantastic steps in making it something
special.  This week he will start implementing the finishing touches on this aspect of the project.

Bryan – This week Machine Learning is at the top of the priority list.  This was a stretch goal we had for ourselves,
but Matt and Bryan are super confident this can be put in place before we complete the project.  As a secondary
function Bryan will be looking at cropping photos to make them easier for the program to read.

Alan – Those flowcharts aren’t going to finish themselves!  Alan will be creating new flowcharts for our exit
documentation this week.  He will also be assisting Todd on web layout adjustments this week.

Todd –  Will be making the last few adjustments to the layouts on the website.  There were also a few adjustments
suggested during the last meeting that were suggested that he is going to try and squeeze in before we wrap up.

Check back next week to see what exciting boundaries we will be pushing towards next week!  Also, feel free to check
back in on the regular boundaries too, they need some love.
