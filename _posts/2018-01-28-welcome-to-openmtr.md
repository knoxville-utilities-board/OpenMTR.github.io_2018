### Welcome to the OpenMTR Project!

We are a group of students from [Pellissippi State Community College](https://www.pstcc.edu) that have been tasked with designing an Optical Character Recognition program to read utility meters.

For more information about OpenMTR checkout our [Project Charter](https://OpenMTR.github.io/charter).
