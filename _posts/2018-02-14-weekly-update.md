Here is a Valentine's day update for our labor of love!

Alan is putting the moves on the website this week as he continues to style it in its entirety.  Changes will
start being approved and implemented any time now.

Todd is still building content, Meet the team content has been added!  Not all of the info posted is correct,
but the team is trying to squeeze in a bio while furiously coding everything for this sprint so be sure to check
back periodically for updates.  The Development Tools and Software page is in the works as well, so be on the
lookout for updates there as well.

Matt is still proving to be a gitjitsu master, he's working to sharpen the skills of the rest of team.  Another
week or so he could earn the rank of gitjitsu grand master!  Doing code reviews and managing work flow are also
on the docket for him this week.  He will also be taking the wheel on the Demo Nick has been working on, to add a
few sliders and filters

Bryan has been churning out code like butter all week long, and will be continuing to pump it out for the next
few days, until he shifts gears to bug fixing for a few days.  Once that is complete he will be back on the gas
pedal for coding.

Nick has finished the initial version of the demo project and will now be helping Alan with creating the website theme. He will also be reviewing Matt's Pull Requests for a change!

Check back next week for more updates to how the project is going as well as what innovations we have come up
with for OpenMTR!
