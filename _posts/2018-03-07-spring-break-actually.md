Hello again, letâ€™s get to this weeks updates while the sun is still out!

- Alan is working on adding javascript to our Jekyll site to improve performance and
capability.  He will also be working to implement a few minor changes to the sidebar.

- Nick is working on new filters for the demo project.  He has already completed a handful he was
working on this week.  For the foreseeable future Matt is handing the creative reigns of the
demo project over to him to begin adding a more "walk through" friendly feature to the demo.

- Bryan has accomplished a multitude of developments on the main project and is currently working
on dial reading.  He has some phenomenal ideas for dial detection and is working to find the
needle and find which number its looking at.

- Todd is going to be changing up the "Meet the Team" page up completely, as the previous layout
considerations proved to be too busy.  Changes include a page for each team members bio, as well
as relevant personal links.  Todd is also going to be working on his tan for this week.

- Matt will be taking this week to start pumping out the details for our presentation.  It's kind
of a big deal so he is getting started early.  Laying out main points/ideas for us to touch on,
separating relevant information and pulling it all together into an almost Broadway like
production.

That sums up this week, check back during spring break for another quick shot of information
on the progress og OpenMTR!
