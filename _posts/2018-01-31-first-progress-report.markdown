Just a quick update from deep within the OpenMTR war room...  Several things have taken place since inception
the first of which being the setup of our GitHub Organization and initializing all necessary repositories.
We have also had our first and second meetings without client [Knoxville utility Board](https://www.kub.org/) to
go over our plan of attack.

More from the technical side, we have established all channels of communication that we plan on using to keep each team member on the up and up as well as communicate with our liaisons from KUB.  For the entirety of our project we will be using Trello, Slack and Discord (for more information on each of these applications see our
[Project Management Page](https://openmtr.github.io/project-management/) ).  The decision was also made to scrap
some previous ideas for software support in favor of other programs.  Our group has decided to use a "Static Code Analysis Tool" called Better Code Hub which allows us to make sure that our code base is following best practices and industry standards.  We also decided that Travis CI would fit our needs better as its continuous integration service will help us verify all every bit of code that we commit for each pull request and ensure that it is being properly built. 

Accomplishments for this week include establishing standards for branching, commit history, pull requests,
code review as well as squash and merge of new content, all of which can be found on out [Developer Workflow Page](https://openmtr.github.io/developer-workflow/) as well as establishing extra-curricular meeting times for us to toss around ideas and discuss any issues that come up within the group.  With the help of Keith we learned to use Docker, or as some like to call it "The Docker," to spin up our Jekyll based site so we can see our changes happen in real time.  We have also delegated out a significant portion of the work necessary for the upcoming sprint to remain on target for deadline.  With any luck our sprint schedule will keep us on task with time to troubleshoot as we go.

Be sure and check back next week for more updates on progress.
