This week may sound uneventful, but I can assure you it isn't. We met up this week and finished
the final paper for our presentation.  This is one of the last steps that we will take before finishing up for
the semester.  Alan has done much of the heavy lifting here but we all needed to meet up and give some
input before we could sign off on it.

We have dove into our individual sections of our final presentation.  This is probably
the most important aspect of the project as we now have to show our clients how we have accomplished what we did
in a professional manner/environment.  Hopefully with the constructive feedback we have provided for one another
our project will go off without a hitch in the next couple of weeks.

Check back in same bat-time, same bat-channel, for where we are the last week of class!
