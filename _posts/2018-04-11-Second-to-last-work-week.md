This week may sound uneventful, but I can assure you it isn't.  This weeks meeting we met up and finished
the final paper for our presentation.  This is on of the last steps that we take before finishing up for
the semester.  Alan has done much of the heavy lifting here but we all needed to meet up and give some
input before we could sign off on it.

We have also gotten very deep into our individual section of our final presentation.  This is probably
most important aspect of the project as we now have to show our clients how we have accomplished what we did
in a professional manner/environment.  Hopefully with the constructive feedback we have provided for one another
we will have a fully functioning project by next week.

Check back in same bat-time, same bat-channel, for where we are the last week of class!
