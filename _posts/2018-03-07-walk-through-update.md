Spring break is finally here!

For most people this means taking some much needed time off, for our group it means working on a presentation for our walk through next week.
It also means working on adding more functionality to the OpenMTR Projects and website because this train never stops.

To give you a little update here is a run down of what everyone will be responsible for during the walk through presentation:

- Matt will be presenting our project charter, workflow, guidelines, and philosophies to help bring some context to the rest of the presentation.

- Alan and Todd will be presenting the website, its evolution, content, and features.

- Nick will be presenting and demonstrating OpenMTRDemo which will show a multitude of features he has worked on diligently to perfect.

- Bryan will be showing off OpenMTR with some step by step imagery to demonstrate the image recognition process and its complexity.

On an awesome side note Brian also got a dial meter reading this week!

Keep checking back here for our weekly progress!
