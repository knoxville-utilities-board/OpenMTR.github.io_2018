Welcome back, and thanks for checking up on progress this week.  Here is a quick recap of what is
going on before we hit the beach for a week!

- Todd has finished the 'Development tools and software' page this past week and he will continue to update it as our
needs increase and change, with plans to change the layout.  
The Meet the Team page is also live, while a new more attractive layout is on the way.

- Alan is continuing work for website beautification.  
He has some very big ideas that will begin rolling out soon.

- Bryan's first meter read worked last Wednesday, this week he is working on obtaining dial reads.
He has a hefty metadata file to work with so hopefully all of the new data can be used to assist with machine learning.
This could help determine the difference between dials and digital meters as well as gas, water, and electric.

- Matt and Nick are diving back into the demo program as a pair into OpenMTRDemo to resolve a few issues as well as putting a brand new
face on the application.

As a whole, the team also did some planning for spring break to include arranging meeting times and activities.
Big things are still to come.
