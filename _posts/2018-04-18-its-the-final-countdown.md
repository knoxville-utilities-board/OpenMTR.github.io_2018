Today was our time to shine.  We had an earlier than normal meeting, to put all the pieces together
and we have built something fantastic!  We have pulled our 40 minute presentation down to about 20 minutes
without sacrificing content or the delivery.  Our instructor was very impressed and we think our client will
be just as enthusiastic.  Only time will tell.  We still have a few kinks to work out of the delivery both
with our speeches themselves and with hardware.  I think all in all we have all done some serious work here
and I am glad we all got to work together on this project.  I will be sure and get back here one more time
just to let everyone know how we did.
