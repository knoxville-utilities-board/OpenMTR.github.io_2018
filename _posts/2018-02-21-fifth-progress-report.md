Here is this weeks progress report for out project!

* Alan and Nick are hard at work styling the website, running through various templates and trying to counter balance colors.
They are closing in on something close to what the final site will look like, although you have probably already noticed the changes.

* Bryan, through sheer determination and a sprinkling of wisdom from Matt, has presented us with our first correct meter read!
A review of his pull request is in the very near future but everyone is excited!
Meetings regarding design decisions as OpenMTR moves towards maturity are definitely on the docket for Matt and Bryan.

* Todd is still hard at work generating content to the website.
Developer tools and software page is still in the works but should be completed before next week.
The meet our team page is complete, but needs some formatting.
Stay tuned for those coming soon.

* Matt is directing workflow, delegating tasks, and putting out fires.
He has assisted everyone on the team with one issue or another this week whether it be creative, technical or logistical.
