This week has been a whirlwind!  Our website is still undergoing changes in both design and content so keep up to speed at [OpenMTR](https://openmtr.github.io/).  We will be having weekly updates on progression and any other pertinent information updates for public consumption.  Keep an eye on the Project management page as it will be updated soon with all of our software needs changes, as well as the new "Our Team" page.  This will help better understand the individuals putting this ambitious project together.

Individually, here is what the team is working on this week:
- Brian is working on getting the first meter read in OpenMTR.  
- Nick is working on building a demo project so the group can see what the filters are doing in real time.  
- Matt has been a fully functional help desk this week as well as working closely with Nick and Brian to move forward with this sprint.  
- Alan is looking learning to use Markdown for the styling of the website.  
- Todd is working on the weekly update, also getting more content ready to put on the website.

As always, check back next week for more details!
