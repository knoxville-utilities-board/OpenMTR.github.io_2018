Last week was our midterm presentation and it went wonderful!  Nobody got ridiculously lost, at
least as far as I could tell, and our instructor seemed to be very impressed with everything we
have accomplished so far.  Everyone did a great job explaining the work they have put in, the
systems they have used and how they accomplished their task.

For this coming week here is a breakdown of what the team will be working on.  We hope you are
just as excited as we are to see this through, and I suspect that since you are still reading
our updates that you probably are!

- Matt will be working close with Brian and Nick this week  to make sure both sides are syncing up well
and running smoothly. He will also be checking in with Alan and Todd on there tasks since time is of the
essence.

- Alan is working on the final report for our professor.  It is a big undertaking as it
chronicles the complete journey of OpenMTR, from our first meeting with KUB until now.  This is
one of the few portions of work that we must squeeze in that would be considered class work.
Alan is doing us all a favor by tackling it alone

- Todd will be working on different layouts for various pages on the website, as well as
sharpening some previously completed projects so that they stay just as polished as the new look
of the website.

- Nick had a super successful demo program for our presentation, but he will still be churning
out more and more features to keep up with the evolution of the working OpenMTR
project.  To better show off workflow, he will be isolating steps and images as it runs to
give a better idea of what the program does that the user will never see.

- Bryan will be diving further into OpenMTR this week.  His main goal is to improve detection
workflow using multi-pass decision logic to handle a wider array of situations regarding images of meters.

Thanks for stopping by to check up, we are almost to the home stretch!  Things will continue to
get more and more exciting as we near the end of our time to complete!  See you next week!
