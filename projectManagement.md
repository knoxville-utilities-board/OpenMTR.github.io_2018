## Team Assignment Structure

<!-- Fill this out at a later date -->

## Communication
- [Trello](https://trello.com/about) uses a card system that allows all team members to see what tasks need<br /> to be done and who is doing them.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) allowed our team to communicate in real time and also allowed for continuous <br /> integration with Trello which updated team members when cards were added, moved, <br />or removed from lists.
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) allowed our team to have meetings when we weren't all able to meet in one location.

## Version Control
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an open source version control system designed for software projects big and small.
- [Github](https://github.com/) is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of git as well as adding its own features.

## Continuous integration
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is an open source automation server and provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project, that allows you to watch testing in real time.

## Static Code Analysis
- [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com/)  is a "Static Code Analysis Tool" which allows us to make sure that our code base is following best practices and industry standards, that uses multiple metrics.  it then takes each metric and runs it against multiple fixed thresholds.
