## Team Assignment Structure

<!-- Fill this out at a later date -->

## Communication
- [Trello](https://trello.com/about) uses a card system that allows all team members to see what tasks need<br /> to be done and who is doing them.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) allowed our team to communicate in real time and also allowed for continuous <br /> integration with Trello which updated team members when cards were added, moved, <br />or removed from lists.
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) allowed our team to have meetings when we weren't all able to meet in one location.

## Version Control
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an open source version control system designed for software projects big and small.
- [Github](https://github.com/) is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of git as well as adding its own features.

## Continuous integration
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is an open source automation server and provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

## Static Code Analysis
- [Sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)  provides the capability to not only show health of an application but also to highlight issues newly introduced. With a Quality Gate in place, you can fix the leak and therefore improve code quality systematically.
