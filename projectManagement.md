## Team Structure


## Communication

- [Trello](https://trello.com/about) uses a card system that allows all team members to see what tasks need<br /> to be done and who is doing them.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) allowed our team to communicate in real time and also allowed for continuous <br /> integration with Trello which updated team members when cards were added, moved, <br />
or removed from lists.
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) allowed our team to have meetings when we weren't all able to meet in one location.

## Version Control

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an open source version control system designed for software projects big and small.
- [Github](https://github.com/) is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of git as well as adding its own features.
