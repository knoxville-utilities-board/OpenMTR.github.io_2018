## Commit Messages

Well formatted commit messages will aid in the ability to follow the history of the project.
For our project we will use 5 types of commit messages:
- ### chore
  These messages will be associated with creating or deleting files within a project.<br/> An example of a chore commit message : `chore: Created new developerWorkflow page`
- ### refactor
  These messages will deal with code refactors big or small.
  <br/>An example of a refactor commit message: `refactor: Reworked GetPathFromUser method`
- ### update
  These message will deal with updating of dependencies,
- ### fix
- ### feat
